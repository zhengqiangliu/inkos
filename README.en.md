Open-source CLI AI Agent that autonomously writes, audits, and revises novels — with human review gates that keep you in control. Supports LitRPG, Progression Fantasy, Isekai, Romantasy, Sci-Fi, and more. Continuation, spinoff, fanfic, and style imitation workflows built in.

**Native English novel writing now supported！** — 10 built-in English genre profiles with dedicated pacing rules, fatigue word lists, and audit dimensions. Set `--lang en` and go.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm i -g @actalk/inkos
```

### Use via OpenClaw 🦞

InkOS is published as an [OpenClaw](https://clawhub.ai/narcooo/inkos) Skill, callable by any compatible agent (Claude Code, OpenClaw, etc.):

```bash
clawhub install inkos          # Install from ClawHub
```

If you installed via npm or cloned the repo, `skills/SKILL.md` is already included — 🦞 can read it directly without a separate ClawHub install.

Once installed, Claw can invoke InkOS atomic commands and control-surface operations (`plan chapter`/`compose chapter`/`draft`/`audit`/`revise`/`write next`) via `exec`, with `--json` output for structured decision-making. The recommended flow is: update `author_intent.md` or `current_focus.md`, run `plan` / `compose`, then decide whether to call `draft` or the full `write next` pipeline. You can also browse it on [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai) by searching `inkos`.

### Configure

**Option 1: Global config (recommended, one-time setup)**

```bash
inkos config set-global \
  --lang en \
  --provider <openai|anthropic|custom> \
  --base-url <API endpoint> \
  --api-key <your API key> \
  --model <model name>

# provider: openai / anthropic / custom (use custom for OpenAI-compatible proxies)
# base-url: your API provider URL
# api-key: your API key
# model: your model name
```

`--lang en` sets English as the default writing language for all projects. Saved to `~/.inkos/.env`. New projects just work without extra config.

**Option 2: Per-project `.env`**

```bash
inkos init my-novel     # Initialize project
# Edit my-novel/.env
```

```bash
# Required
INKOS_LLM_PROVIDER=                               # openai / anthropic / custom (use custom for any OpenAI-compatible API)
INKOS_LLM_BASE_URL=                               # API endpoint
INKOS_LLM_API_KEY=                                 # API Key
INKOS_LLM_MODEL=                                   # Model name

# Language (defaults to global setting or genre default)
# INKOS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en                        # en or zh

# Optional
# INKOS_LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.7                       # Temperature
# INKOS_LLM_MAX_TOKENS=8192                        # Max output tokens
# INKOS_LLM_THINKING_BUDGET=0                      # Anthropic extended thinking budget
```

Project `.env` overrides global config. Skip it if no override needed.

**Option 3: Multi-model routing (optional)**

Assign different models to different agents — balance quality and cost:

```bash
# Assign different models/providers to different agents
inkos config set-model writer <model> --provider <provider> --base-url <url> --api-key-env <ENV_VAR>
inkos config set-model auditor <model> --provider <provider>
inkos config show-models        # View current routing
```

Agents without explicit overrides fall back to the global model.

### v0.6 Update

**Structured State + Hook Governance + Length Governance**

Addresses three systemic long-form writing problems: **context bloat after 20+ chapters causing slowdowns and 400 errors** (Settler full injection → JSON delta + selective retrieval), **hooks only accumulate, never resolve, ~0% payoff rate** (Planner scheduling + Settler blind spot fix + audit debt tracking), **word count deviation 50%+ and normalizer destroying chapters** (LengthSpec + safety net).

- Pipeline upgraded to 10 agents: adds Planner, Composer, Observer, Reflector, Normalizer
- Truth files moved to `story/state/*.json` (Zod validated); Settler outputs JSON delta instead of full markdown; legacy books auto-migrate
- SQLite temporal memory database on Node 22+ for relevance-based retrieval
- Planner generates `hookAgenda` to schedule hook advancement and payoff; Settler working set expanded to cover dormant debt
- New `mention` semantics prevents fake hook advancement; `analyzeHookHealth` audits hook debt; `evaluateHookAdmission` blocks duplicate hooks
- Length governance: `LengthSpec` + Normalizer single-pass correction with safety net against destructive normalization
- User `INKOS_LLM_MAX_TOKENS` acts as global cap; reserved keys in `llm.extra` auto-stripped
- Cross-chapter repetition detection, dialogue-driven guidance, English variance brief, multi-character scene resistance
- Chapter summary dedup, ESM node:sqlite fix, consolidate full-width parenthesis support
- Bilingual CLI output and logging

### Write Your First Book

English is the default for English genre profiles. Pick a genre and go:

```bash
inkos book create --title "The Last Delver" --genre litrpg     # LitRPG novel (English by default)
inkos write next my-book          # Write next chapter (full pipeline: draft → audit → revise)
inkos status                      # Check status
inkos review list my-book         # Review drafts
inkos review approve-all my-book  # Batch approve
inkos export my-book --format epub  # Export EPUB (read on phone/Kindle)
```

Language is set per-genre by default. Override explicitly with `--lang en` or `--lang zh`. Use `inkos genre list` to see all available genres and their default languages.

## English Genre Profiles

InkOS ships with 10 English-native genre profiles. Each includes genre-specific rules, pacing, fatigue word detection, and audit dimensions:

| Genre | Key Mechanics |
|-------|--------------|
| **LitRPG** | Numerical system, power scaling, stat progression |
| **Progression Fantasy** | Power scaling, no numerical system required |
| **Isekai** | Era research, world contrast, cultural fish-out-of-water |
| **Cultivation** | Power scaling, realm progression |
| **System Apocalypse** | Numerical system, survival mechanics |
| **Dungeon Core** | Numerical system, power scaling, territory management |
| **Romantasy** | Emotional arcs, dual POV pacing |
| **Sci-Fi** | Era research, tech consistency |
| **Tower Climber** | Numerical system, floor progression |
| **Cozy Fantasy** | Low-stakes pacing, comfort-first tone |

Also supports 5 Chinese web novel genres (xuanhuan, xianxia, urban, horror, other) for bilingual creators.

Every genre includes a **fatigue word list** (e.g., "delve", "tapestry", "testament", "intricate", "pivotal" for LitRPG) — the auditor flags these automatically so your prose doesn't read like every other AI-generated novel.

## Key Features

### 33-Dimension Audit + De-AI-ification

The Continuity Auditor agent checks every draft across 33 dimensions: character memory, resource continuity, hook payoff, outline adherence, narrative pacing, emotional arcs, and more. Built-in AI-tell detection automatically catches "LLM voice" — overused words, monotonous sentence patterns, excessive summarization. Failed audits trigger an automatic revision loop.

De-AI-ification rules are baked into the Writer agent's prompts: fatigue word lists, banned patterns, style fingerprint injection — reducing AI traces at the source. `revise --mode anti-detect` runs dedicated anti-detection rewriting on existing chapters.

### Style Cloning

`inkos style analyze` examines reference text and extracts a statistical fingerprint (sentence length distribution, word frequency patterns, rhythm profiles) plus an LLM-readable style guide. `inkos style import` injects this fingerprint into a book — all future chapters adopt the style, and the Reviser audits against it.

### Creative Brief

`inkos book create --brief my-ideas.md` — pass your brainstorming notes, worldbuilding doc, or character sheets. The Architect agent builds from your brief (generating `story_bible.md` and `book_rules.md`) instead of inventing from scratch, and persists the brief into `story/author_intent.md` so the book's long-horizon intent does not disappear after initialization.

### Input Governance Control Surface

Every book now has two long-lived Markdown control docs:

- `story/author_intent.md`: what this book should become over the long horizon
- `story/current_focus.md`: what the next 1-3 chapters should pull attention back toward

Before writing, you can run:

```bash
inkos plan chapter my-book --context "Pull attention back to the mentor conflict first"
inkos compose chapter my-book
```

This generates `story/runtime/chapter-XXXX.intent.md`, `context.json`, `rule-stack.yaml`, and `trace.json`. `intent.md` is the human-readable contract; the others are execution/debug artifacts. `plan` / `compose` only compile local documents and state, so they can run before you finish API key setup.

### Length Governance

`draft`, `write next`, and `revise` now share the same conservative length governor:

- `--words` sets a target band, not an exact hard promise
- Chinese chapters default to `zh_chars`; English chapters default to `en_words`
- If the chapter drifts outside the soft band, InkOS may run one corrective normalization pass (compress or expand) instead of hard-cutting prose
- If the chapter still misses the hard range after that one pass, InkOS still saves it, but surfaces a visible length warning and telemetry in the result and chapter index

### Continuation Writing

`inkos import chapters` imports existing novel text, auto reverse-engineers all 7 truth files (world state, character matrix, resource ledger, plot hooks, etc.), supports `Chapter N` and custom split patterns, and resumable import. After import, `inkos write next` seamlessly continues the story.

### Fan Fiction

`inkos fanfic init --from source.txt --mode canon` creates a fanfic book from source material. Four modes: canon (faithful continuation), au (alternate universe), ooc (out of character), cp (ship-focused). Includes a canon importer, fanfic-specific audit dimensions, and information boundary controls to keep lore consistent.

### Multi-Model Routing

Different agents can use different models and providers. Writer on Claude (stronger creative), Auditor on GPT-4o (cheaper and fast), Radar on a local model (zero cost). `inkos config set-model` configures per-agent; unconfigured agents fall back to the global model.

### Daemon Mode + Notifications

`inkos up` starts an autonomous background loop that writes chapters on a schedule. The pipeline runs fully unattended for non-critical issues, pausing for human review when needed. Notifications via Telegram and Webhook (HMAC-SHA256 signing + event filtering). Logs to `inkos.log` (JSON Lines), `-q` for quiet mode.

### Local Model Compatibility

Supports any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`--provider custom`). Stream auto-fallback — when SSE isn't supported, InkOS retries with sync mode automatically. Fallback parser handles non-standard output from smaller models, and partial content recovery kicks in on stream interruption.

### Reliability

Every chapter creates an automatic state snapshot — `inkos write rewrite` rolls back any chapter to its pre-write state. The Writer outputs a pre-write checklist (context scope, resources, pending hooks, risks) and a post-write settlement table; the Auditor cross-validates both. File locking prevents concurrent writes. Post-write validator includes cross-chapter repetition detection and 11 hard rules with auto spot-fix.

The hook system uses Zod schema validation — `lastAdvancedChapter` must be an integer, `status` can only be open/progressing/deferred/resolved. JSON deltas from the LLM are processed through `applyRuntimeStateDelta` (immutable update) and `validateRuntimeState` (structural check) before persistence. Corrupted data is rejected, not propagated.

User-configured `INKOS_LLM_MAX_TOKENS` now acts as a global cap on all API calls. Reserved keys in `llm.extra` (max_tokens, temperature, etc.) are automatically stripped to prevent accidental overrides.

## How It Works

Each chapter is produced by multiple agents in sequence, with zero human intervention:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshot-pipeline.png" width="800" alt="Pipeline diagram">
</p>

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Radar** | Scans platform trends and reader preferences to inform story direction (pluggable, skippable) |
| **Planner** | Reads author intent + current focus + memory retrieval results, produces chapter intent (must-keep / must-avoid) |
| **Composer** | Selects relevant context from all truth files by relevance, compiles rule stack and runtime artifacts |
| **Architect** | Plans chapter structure: outline, scene beats, pacing targets |
| **Writer** | Produces prose from the composed context (length-governed, dialogue-driven) |
| **Observer** | Over-extracts 9 categories of facts from the chapter text (characters, locations, resources, relationships, emotions, information, hooks, time, physical state) |
| **Reflector** | Outputs a JSON delta (not full markdown); code-layer applies Zod schema validation then immutable write |
| **Normalizer** | Single-pass compress/expand to bring chapter length into the target band |
| **Continuity Auditor** | Validates the draft against 7 canonical truth files, 33-dimension check |
| **Reviser** | Fixes issues found by the auditor — auto-fixes critical problems, flags others for human review |

If the audit fails, the pipeline automatically enters a revise → re-audit loop until all critical issues are resolved.

### Canonical Truth Files

Every book maintains 7 truth files as the single source of truth:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `current_state.md` | World state: character locations, relationships, knowledge, emotional arcs |
| `particle_ledger.md` | Resource accounting: items, money, supplies with quantities and decay tracking |
| `pending_hooks.md` | Open plot threads: foreshadowing planted, promises to readers, unresolved conflicts |
| `chapter_summaries.md` | Per-chapter summaries: characters, key events, state changes, hook dynamics |
| `subplot_board.md` | Subplot progress board: A/B/C line status tracking |
| `emotional_arcs.md` | Emotional arcs: per-character emotion tracking and growth |
| `character_matrix.md` | Character interaction matrix: encounter records, information boundaries |

The Continuity Auditor checks every draft against these files. If a character "remembers" something they never witnessed, or pulls a weapon they lost two chapters ago, the auditor catches it.

Since 0.6.0, the authoritative source for truth files has moved from markdown to `story/state/*.json` (Zod schema validated). The Settler no longer outputs full markdown files — it produces a JSON delta that is immutably applied and structurally validated before persistence. Markdown files are retained as human-readable projections. Existing books auto-migrate on first run.

On Node 22+, a SQLite temporal memory database (`story/memory.db`) is automatically enabled, supporting relevance-based retrieval of historical facts, hooks, and chapter summaries — preventing context bloat from full-file injection.

</p>

### Control Surface and Runtime Artifacts

Alongside the 7 truth files, InkOS splits guardrails from customization into reviewable control docs:

- `story/author_intent.md`: long-horizon author intent
- `story/current_focus.md`: near-term steering
- `story/runtime/chapter-XXXX.intent.md`: chapter goal, keep/avoid list, conflict resolution
- `story/runtime/chapter-XXXX.context.json`: the actual context selected for this chapter
- `story/runtime/chapter-XXXX.rule-stack.yaml`: priority layers and override relationships
- `story/runtime/chapter-XXXX.trace.json`: compilation trace for this chapter

That means briefs, outline nodes, book rules, and current requests are no longer mashed into one prompt blob; InkOS compiles them first, then writes.

### Writing Rule System

The Writer agent has ~25 universal writing rules (character craft, narrative technique, logical consistency, language constraints, de-AI-ification), applicable to all genres.

On top of that, each genre has dedicated rules (prohibitions, language constraints, pacing, audit dimensions), and each book has its own `book_rules.md` (protagonist personality, numerical caps, custom prohibitions), `story_bible.md` (worldbuilding), `author_intent.md` (long-horizon direction), and `current_focus.md` (near-term steering). `volume_outline.md` still acts as the default plan, but in v2 input governance it no longer automatically overrides the current chapter intent.

## Usage Modes

InkOS provides three interaction modes, all sharing the same atomic operations:

### 1. Full Pipeline (One Command)

```bash
inkos write next my-book              # Draft → audit → auto-revise, all in one
inkos write next my-book --count 5    # Write 5 chapters in sequence
```

`write next` now uses the `plan -> compose -> write` governance chain by default. If you need the older prompt-assembly path, set this explicitly in `inkos.json`:

```json
{
  "inputGovernanceMode": "legacy"
}
```

The default is now `v2`. `legacy` remains available as an explicit fallback.

### 2. Atomic Commands (Composable, External Agent Friendly)

```bash
inkos plan chapter my-book --context "Focus on the mentor conflict first" --json
inkos compose chapter my-book --json
inkos draft my-book --context "Focus on the dungeon boss encounter and party dynamics" --json
inkos audit my-book 31 --json
inkos revise my-book 31 --json
```

Each command performs a single operation independently. `--json` outputs structured data. `plan` / `compose` govern inputs; `draft` / `audit` / `revise` handle prose and quality checks. They can be called by external AI agents via `exec`, or used in scripts.

### 3. Natural Language Agent Mode

```bash
inkos agent "Write a LitRPG novel where the MC is a healer class in a dungeon world"
inkos agent "Write the next chapter, focus on the boss fight and loot distribution"
inkos agent "Create a progression fantasy about a mage who can only use one spell"
```

18 built-in tools (write_draft, plan_chapter, compose_chapter, audit_chapter, revise_chapter, scan_market, create_book, update_author_intent, update_current_focus, get_book_status, read_truth_files, list_books, write_full_pipeline, web_fetch, import_style, import_canon, import_chapters, write_truth_file), with the LLM deciding call order via tool-use. The recommended agent flow is: adjust the control surface first, then `plan` / `compose`, then choose draft-only or full-pipeline writing.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `inkos init [name]` | Initialize project (omit name to init current directory) |
| `inkos book create` | Create a new book (`--genre`, `--chapter-words`, `--target-chapters`, `--brief <file>`, `--lang en/zh`) |
| `inkos book update [id]` | Update book settings (`--chapter-words`, `--target-chapters`, `--status`, `--lang`) |
| `inkos book list` | List all books |
| `inkos book delete <id>` | Delete a book and all its data (`--force` to skip confirmation) |
| `inkos genre list/show/copy/create` | View, copy, or create genres |
| `inkos plan chapter [id]` | Generate the next chapter's `intent.md` (`--context` / `--context-file` for current steering) |
| `inkos compose chapter [id]` | Generate the next chapter's `context.json`, `rule-stack.yaml`, and `trace.json` |
| `inkos write next [id]` | Full pipeline: write next chapter (`--words` to override, `--count` for batch, `-q` quiet mode) |
| `inkos write rewrite [id] <n>` | Rewrite chapter N (restores state snapshot, `--force` to skip confirmation) |
| `inkos draft [id]` | Write draft only (`--words` to override word count, `-q` quiet mode) |
| `inkos audit [id] [n]` | Audit a specific chapter |
| `inkos revise [id] [n]` | Revise a specific chapter |
| `inkos agent <instruction>` | Natural language agent mode |
| `inkos review list [id]` | Review drafts |
| `inkos review approve-all [id]` | Batch approve |
| `inkos status [id]` | Project status |
| `inkos export [id]` | Export book (`--format txt/md/epub`, `--output <path>`, `--approved-only`) |
| `inkos fanfic init` | Create a fanfic book from source material (`--from`, `--mode canon/au/ooc/cp`) |
| `inkos config set-global` | Set global LLM config (~/.inkos/.env) |
| `inkos config set-model <agent> <model>` | Per-agent model override (`--base-url`, `--provider`, `--api-key-env`) |
| `inkos config show-models` | Show current model routing |
| `inkos doctor` | Diagnose setup issues (API connectivity test + provider compatibility hints) |
| `inkos detect [id] [n]` | AIGC detection (`--all` for all chapters, `--stats` for statistics) |
| `inkos style analyze <file>` | Analyze reference text to extract style fingerprint |
| `inkos style import <file> [id]` | Import style fingerprint into a book |
| `inkos import chapters [id] --from <path>` | Import existing chapters for continuation (`--split`, `--resume-from`) |

| `inkos up / down` | Start/stop daemon (`-q` quiet mode, auto-writes `inkos.log`) |

`[id]` is auto-detected when the project has only one book. All commands support `--json` for structured output. `draft` / `write next` / `plan chapter` / `compose chapter` accept `--context` for steering, and `--words` overrides the target chapter size. `book create` supports `--brief <file>` to pass a creative brief — the Architect builds from your ideas instead of generating from scratch. `plan chapter` / `compose chapter` do not require a live LLM, so you can inspect governed inputs before finishing API setup.

## Roadmap

- [ ] `packages/studio` Web UI for review and editing (Vite + React + Hono)
- [ ] Partial chapter intervention (rewrite half a chapter + cascade truth file updates)
- [ ] Novel-to-comic pipeline (truth files → storyboard → manga pages)
- [ ] Custom agent plugin system
