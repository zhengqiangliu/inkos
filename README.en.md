Open-source CLI agent that autonomously writes, audits, and revises novels — with human review gates that keep you in control.

**Native English support** — InkOS writes English fiction out of the box with 10 built-in genre profiles: LitRPG, Progression Fantasy, Isekai, Cultivation, System Apocalypse, Dungeon Core, Romantasy, Sci-Fi, Tower Climber, and Cozy Fantasy. Each genre includes dedicated pacing rules, fatigue word lists, audit dimensions, and prohibition sets tuned for English-language web fiction.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm i -g @actalk/inkos
```

### Use via OpenClaw 🦞

InkOS is published as an [OpenClaw](https://clawhub.ai) Skill, callable by any compatible agent (Claude Code, OpenClaw, etc.):

```bash
clawhub install inkos          # Install from ClawHub
```

If you installed via npm or cloned the repo, `skills/SKILL.md` is already included — 🦞 can read it directly without a separate ClawHub install.

Once installed, Claw can invoke all InkOS atomic commands (`draft`/`audit`/`revise`/`write next`) via `exec`, with `--json` output for structured decision-making. You can also browse it on [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai) by searching `inkos`.

### Configure

**Option 1: Global config (recommended, one-time setup)**

```bash
inkos config set-global \
  --provider <openai|anthropic|custom> \
  --base-url <API endpoint> \
  --api-key <your API key> \
  --model <model name>

# Example: OpenAI
# inkos config set-global --provider openai --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 --api-key sk-xxx --model gpt-4o
# Example: Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (proxies, Zhipu, Gemini, local models)
# inkos config set-global --provider custom --base-url https://your-proxy.com/v1 --api-key sk-xxx --model gpt-4o
# Example: Anthropic
# inkos config set-global --provider anthropic --base-url https://api.anthropic.com --api-key sk-ant-xxx --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

Saved to `~/.inkos/.env`, shared by all projects. New projects just work without extra config.

**Option 2: Per-project `.env`**

```bash
inkos init my-novel     # Initialize project
# Edit my-novel/.env
```

```bash
# Required
INKOS_LLM_PROVIDER=                               # openai / anthropic / custom (use custom for any OpenAI-compatible API)
INKOS_LLM_BASE_URL=                               # API endpoint (proxies, Zhipu, Gemini, local models all supported)
INKOS_LLM_API_KEY=                                 # API Key
INKOS_LLM_MODEL=                                   # Model name

# Optional
# INKOS_LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.7                       # Temperature
# INKOS_LLM_MAX_TOKENS=8192                        # Max output tokens
# INKOS_LLM_THINKING_BUDGET=0                      # Anthropic extended thinking budget
```

Project `.env` overrides global config. Skip it if no override needed.

**Option 3: Multi-model routing (optional)**

Assign different models to different agents — balance quality and cost:

```bash
# Writer uses Claude (stronger creative), Auditor uses GPT-4o (cheaper & fast)
inkos config set-model writer claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --provider anthropic --base-url https://api.anthropic.com --api-key-env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
inkos config set-model auditor gpt-4o --provider openai
inkos config show-models        # View current routing
```

Agents without explicit overrides fall back to the global model.

### Write Your First Book

```bash
inkos book create --title "The Last Delver" --genre litrpg --lang en  # Create an English book
inkos write next my-book          # Write next chapter (full pipeline: draft → audit → revise)
inkos status                      # Check status
inkos review list my-book         # Review drafts
inkos review approve-all my-book  # Batch approve
inkos export my-book              # Export full book
inkos export my-book --format epub  # Export EPUB (read on phone/Kindle)
```

## Key Features

### 33-Dimension Audit + De-AI-ification

The Continuity Auditor checks every draft across 33 dimensions: character memory, resource continuity, hook payoff, outline adherence, narrative pacing, emotional arcs, and more. Built-in AI-tell detection dimensions automatically catch "LLM voice" — overused words, monotonous sentence patterns, excessive summarization. Failed audits trigger an automatic revision loop.

De-AI-ification rules are baked into the Writer agent's prompts: fatigue word lists, banned patterns, style fingerprint injection — reducing AI traces at the source. `revise --mode anti-detect` runs dedicated anti-detection rewriting on existing chapters.

### Style Cloning

`inkos style analyze` examines reference text and extracts a statistical fingerprint (sentence length distribution, word frequency patterns, rhythm profiles) plus an LLM-readable style guide. `inkos style import` injects this fingerprint into a book — all future chapters adopt the style, and the Reviser audits against it.

### Creative Brief

`inkos book create --brief my-ideas.md` — pass your brainstorming notes, worldbuilding doc, or character sheets. The Architect agent builds from your brief (generating story_bible.md and book_rules.md) instead of inventing from scratch.

### Continuation Writing

`inkos import chapters` imports existing novel text, auto reverse-engineers all 7 truth files (world state, character matrix, resource ledger, plot hooks, etc.), supports `Chapter N` and custom split patterns, and resumable import. After import, `inkos write next` seamlessly continues the story.

### Fan Fiction

`inkos fanfic init --from source.txt --mode canon` creates a fanfic book from source material. Four modes: canon (faithful continuation), au (alternate universe), ooc (out of character), cp (ship-focused). Includes a canon importer, fanfic-specific audit dimensions, and information boundary controls to keep lore consistent.

### Multi-Model Routing

Different agents can use different models and providers. Writer on Claude (stronger creative), Auditor on GPT-4o (cheaper and fast), Radar on a local model (zero cost). `inkos config set-model` configures per-agent; unconfigured agents fall back to the global model.

### Daemon Mode + Notifications

`inkos up` starts an autonomous background loop that writes chapters on a schedule. The pipeline runs fully unattended for non-critical issues, pausing for human review when needed. Notification support: Telegram, Feishu, WeCom, Webhook (HMAC-SHA256 signing + event filtering). Logs to `inkos.log` (JSON Lines), `-q` for quiet mode.

### Local Model Compatibility

Supports any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`--provider custom`). Stream auto-fallback — when SSE isn't supported, InkOS retries with sync mode automatically. Fallback parser handles non-standard output from small models, and partial content recovery kicks in on stream interruption.

### Reliability

Every chapter creates an automatic state snapshot — `inkos write rewrite` rolls back any chapter to its pre-write state. The Writer outputs a pre-write checklist (context scope, resources, pending hooks, risks) and a post-write settlement table; the Auditor cross-validates both. File locking prevents concurrent writes. Post-write validator enforces 11 hard rules with auto spot-fix.

## How It Works

Each chapter is produced by five agents in sequence:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshot-pipeline.png" width="800" alt="Pipeline diagram">
</p>

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Radar** | Scans platform trends and reader preferences to inform story direction (pluggable, skippable) |
| **Architect** | Plans chapter structure: outline, scene beats, pacing targets |
| **Writer** | Produces prose from the plan + current world state (two-phase: creative writing → state settlement) |
| **Continuity Auditor** | Validates the draft against 7 canonical truth files, 33-dimension check |
| **Reviser** | Fixes issues found by the auditor — auto-fixes critical problems, flags others for human review |

If the audit fails, the pipeline automatically enters a revise → re-audit loop until all critical issues are resolved.

### Canonical Truth Files

Every book maintains 7 truth files as the single source of truth:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `current_state.md` | World state: character locations, relationships, knowledge, emotional arcs |
| `particle_ledger.md` | Resource accounting: items, money, supplies with quantities and decay tracking |
| `pending_hooks.md` | Open plot threads: foreshadowing planted, promises to readers, unresolved conflicts |
| `chapter_summaries.md` | Per-chapter summaries: characters, key events, state changes, hook dynamics |
| `subplot_board.md` | Subplot progress board: A/B/C line status tracking |
| `emotional_arcs.md` | Emotional arcs: per-character emotion tracking and growth |
| `character_matrix.md` | Character interaction matrix: encounter records, information boundaries |

The Continuity Auditor checks every draft against these files. If a character "remembers" something they never witnessed, or pulls a weapon they lost two chapters ago, the auditor catches it.

</p>

### Writing Rule System

The Writer agent has ~25 universal writing rules (character craft, narrative technique, logical consistency, language constraints, de-AI-ification), applicable to all genres.

On top of that, each genre has dedicated rules (prohibitions, language rules, pacing, audit dimensions), and each book has its own `book_rules.md` (protagonist personality, numerical caps, custom prohibitions) and `story_bible.md` (worldbuilding), auto-generated by the Architect agent.

### English Genre Profiles

InkOS ships with 10 English-native genre profiles, each with genre-specific rules, pacing, fatigue words, and audit dimensions:

| Genre | Key Mechanics |
|-------|--------------|
| **LitRPG** | Numerical system, power scaling, stat progression |
| **Progression Fantasy** | Power scaling, no numerical system required |
| **Isekai** | Era research, world contrast, cultural fish-out-of-water |
| **Cultivation** | Power scaling, realm progression |
| **System Apocalypse** | Numerical system, survival mechanics |
| **Dungeon Core** | Numerical system, power scaling, territory management |
| **Romantasy** | Emotional arcs, dual POV pacing |
| **Sci-Fi** | Era research, tech consistency |
| **Tower Climber** | Numerical system, floor progression |
| **Cozy Fantasy** | Low-stakes pacing, comfort-first tone |

Plus 5 Chinese web novel genres (xuanhuan, xianxia, urban, horror, other). Use `--lang en` or `--lang zh` to set the writing language, or let the genre default decide.

## Usage Modes

InkOS provides three interaction modes, all sharing the same atomic operations:

### 1. Full Pipeline (One Command)

```bash
inkos write next my-book              # Draft → audit → auto-revise, all in one
inkos write next my-book --count 5    # Write 5 chapters in sequence
```

### 2. Atomic Commands (Composable, External Agent Friendly)

```bash
inkos draft my-book --context "Focus on master-disciple conflict" --json
inkos audit my-book 31 --json
inkos revise my-book 31 --json
```

Each command performs a single operation independently. `--json` outputs structured data. Can be called by external AI agents via `exec`, or used in scripts.

### 3. Natural Language Agent Mode

```bash
inkos agent "Write a LitRPG novel where the MC is a healer class in a dungeon world"
inkos agent "Write the next chapter, focus on the boss fight"
inkos agent "Scan market trends first, then create a new book based on results"
```

13 built-in tools (write_draft, audit_chapter, revise_chapter, scan_market, create_book, get_book_status, read_truth_files, list_books, write_full_pipeline, web_fetch, import_style, import_canon, import_chapters), with the LLM deciding call order via tool-use.

## Roadmap

- [ ] `packages/studio` Web UI for review and editing (Vite + React + Hono)
- [ ] Partial chapter intervention (rewrite half a chapter + cascade truth file updates)
- [ ] Custom agent plugin system
- [ ] Platform-specific export (Qidian, Tomato, etc.)
